///  @class EnrichmentFacility
///
///  @section introduction Introduction
///  The EnrichmentFacility is a simple Agent to agent the enriching of natural
///  Uranium in a Cyclus simulation. It requests its input recipe (nominally
///  natural Uranium), and produces any amount of enriched Uranium, given the its
///  natural uranium inventory constraint and its SWU capacity constraint.
///
///  @section requests Requests
///  The EnrichmentFacility will request from the cyclus::ResourceExchange a
///  cyclus::Material whose quantity is its remaining inventory capacity and whose
///  composition is that of its input recipe.
///
///  @section acctrade Accepting Trades
///  The EnrichmentFacility adds any accepted trades to its inventory.
///
///  @section bids Bids
///  The EnrichmentFacility will bid on any request for its output commodity. It
///  will bid either the request quantity, or the quanity associated with either
///  its SWU constraint or natural uranium constraint, whichever is lower.
///
///  @section extrades Executing Trades
///  The EnrichmentFacility will execute trades for its output commodity in the
///  following manner:
///    #. Determine the trade's quantity and product assay
///    #. Determine the natural Uranium and SWU requires to create that product
///    #. Remove the required quantity of natural Uranium from its inventory
///    #. Extract the appropriate composition of enriched Uranium
///    #. Send the enriched Uranium as the trade resource
///
///  @section gotchas Gotchas
///  #. In its current form, the EnrichmentFacility can only accept
///  cyclus::Material having the composition of its input recipe. If a
///  cyclus::Material of a different composition is sent to it, an exception will
///  be thrown.
///
///  #. During the trading phase, an exception will be thrown if either the
///  EnrichmentFacility's SWU or inventory constraint is breached.
///
///  @section improvements Improvments
///  The primary improvement to the EnrichmentFacility would be to relax the
///  requirement that all input material have the in_recipe composition (i.e.,
///  allow different base enrichments of Uranium).
///
///  How would I go about doing so? I'd likely develop an EnrichmentBuffer-type
///  class that can be queried as to its SWU and natural Uranium capacity.
